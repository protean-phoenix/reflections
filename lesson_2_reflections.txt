What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A repository is made in the directory where the command is used.
Repositories are needed because they are the things that are used
to make commits (the bounds of all the files to commit).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is the boundaries for files whose changes will be saved
in the next commit, while the working directory contains the current
state of files and the repository contains the boundaries for all
the files that will share commits.
