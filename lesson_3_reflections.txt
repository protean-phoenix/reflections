When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working from more than one device or you are working on a team.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are labels for different timelines of commits in
a repository. Clones are duplicates of repositories. Forks
Are clones from one github account to another.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of
the remote stored locally?

You can compare a local branch to the last known state
of a remote branch

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could have one main repository that the other repositories
made a remote of (through a link). It would be difficult to
communicate because of the lack of a UI.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather
than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Making changes to a branch other than master allows for
different versions and for making merge pull requests.
Merge pull requests allow for others to review the request.
Directly pushing from master is faster.
